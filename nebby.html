<h1>Important - Send to Leader</h1><br/>

Essay<br/>

I don't know what I did for you, is it just because I'm admin on SK? Well evidently not, because you already blocked me before I was even
promoted. Important:<br/>
<h1>I do NOT</h1> <h4> use Salt for spying.</h4><br/>
Your kick for Salt was useless, I never spy people with Salt, that'd give me a really bad reputation.
But anyways. I don't know why you ever blocked me in first place; if it was because I had a famous bot and you were jealous, or if it was because I was staff in SK, it doesn't matter.<br/>
Please. Have mercy with me or even with Salt; let me join thou server, or even be promoted there or something. If you really want to refuse it, then at least unblock me and tell me why. Have a chat.<br/>
I am not your enemy. I'm not an ally of anyone, I'm a rather neutral person.<br/>
There are people who DMed you to do so but you ignored them. So please read this.<br/><br/><br/>
<h3>Thanks.</h3>
